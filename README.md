# k-means-clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into K clusters based on similarity. It starts by randomly selecting K centroids, assigns data points to the nearest centroid, then recalculates the centroids as the mean of the assigned points. This process repeats until the centroids stabilize.
